**Program that simulates a baseball game between any two teams from 2015-2023.**

Using statcast data, this program obtains a team's starting lineup and the percentages of outcomes of each player (HR%, K%, 2B%, etc ...). Using a number generator to determine outcomes of at bats and baserunning, the game is simulated.
